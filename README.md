# yasl
The goal of YASL is:

  - Use an exotik coding language that you may not see again after this rush
  - Solve a fun problem
  - Make you confident in your **adaptation** capacity
  - Make you think and code in a different way that you have done so far (in C, C++, ...)

  YASL is a rather old coding language functionning with multiple reverted stacks. De-
tails of this concept are described in the provided man with the yasl interpreter. You
will need to rethink your way of storing and manipulating data.

  As starters, you will face several small and academic exercises to get accointed with
this language. A small part of the final mark but necessary for a successful completion
of the following parts.
Then comes the main course: display of a base-64-encoded image in your terminal.
Just in case you’re still hungry, you’ll find some dessert at the end.
